PROJECT: 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops


This directory is created to house all the c-files, scripts and codes to
answer the various pproject tasks required for this project.

Tasks
0. _putchar / prints _putchar
1. the alphabet game /  prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. 10 x alphabet /  prints 10 times the alphabet
3. islower /  checks for lowercase character.
4. isalpha / checks for alphabetic character.
5. Sign / prints the sign of a number.
6. Absolute value / computes the absolute value of an integer
7. Game of digits /  prints the last digit of a number.
8. Agent Jack Bauer / prints every minute of the day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9. Learn your times table /  prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10. a + b / adds two integers and returns the result.
11. 98 Battery Street, the OG /  prints all natural numbers from n to 98
12. Multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation / prints the n times table, starting with 0.
13. Nature made the natural numbers / computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
14. Fibonacci numbers /  prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
15. Even Liber Abbaci /  finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
16. Fibonacci numbers / prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2


At the end, it is my hope that I woul have been grounded in C -Functions, nested loops etc.
